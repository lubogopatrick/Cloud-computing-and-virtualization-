Cloud computing and virtualization are two related but distinct concepts:

Cloud Computing:

- On-demand access to shared computing resources (servers, storage, applications, etc.) over the internet
- Resources are dynamically allocated and scaled based on demand
- Pay-as-you-go pricing model
- Characteristics: on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, measured service

Virtualization:

- Creating a virtual version of a physical resource (server, desktop, network, etc.)
- Multiple virtual resources can run on a single physical resource
- Virtual resources are isolated from each other and from the physical resource
- Benefits: hardware abstraction, improved resource utilization, increased flexibility, and easier management

Key differences:

- Cloud computing focuses on delivering computing resources over the internet
- Virtualization focuses on creating virtual resources on a physical infrastructure

Types of virtualization:

- Server virtualization
- Desktop virtualization
- Network virtualization
- Storage virtualization

Cloud computing deployment models:

- Public cloud
- Private cloud
- Hybrid cloud
- Community cloud

Cloud computing service models:

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)

In summary, virtualization is a technology that enables cloud computing by allowing multiple virtual resources to run on a single physical resource, increasing resource utilization and flexibility. Cloud computing is a service model that delivers computing resources over the internet, leveraging virtualization to provide scalable and on-demand resources.
